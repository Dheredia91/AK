      question: "How does the asphalt estimate calculator work?",
      answer:
        "The calculator estimates costs based on the square footage or dimensions you provide. It factors in the cost per square foot based on area size and applies an adjustment based on thickness (light, medium, or heavy).",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I determine the square footage of my project?",
      answer:
        "If your project is rectangular, multiply the length by the width. If itâ€™s irregularly shaped, break it into smaller rectangles, calculate their areas, and add them together.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I determine the correct thickness for my asphalt?",
      answer:
        "Residential driveways usually require 2-3 inches of asphalt. Light-use parking lots typically need 4 inches, while heavy-use lots may require 6-8 inches. A compacted gravel base is recommended for durability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my estimate shown as a price range?",
      answer:
        "The range accounts for potential cost fluctuations due to labor, material prices, and site conditions. The lower end of the estimate is 10% below the base calculation, and the higher end is 10% above it.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I rely on this estimate for my project budget?",
      answer:
        "This estimate provides a rough cost range. However, factors like soil conditions, prep work, and regional pricing can affect the final cost. Contact us for a detailed, site-specific estimate.",
